// The procedure previously used in GEM pedestal calculation for SRS

GEM pedestal contains: strip offset and strip noise
A strip signal contains 6 (for instance) time samples

Step 1): in each event:
   
  1.1) get offset common mode for each time sample
      offset_common_mode = average ADC value for the 128 strips 
                           in each time sample

  1.2) get offset for each strip:
      strip_offset = the average ADC for these 6 time samples

  1.3) get noise  for each strip:
     strip_noise = \Sum (ADC_in_each_time_sample - offset_commonmode[ts]) / 6
           a.k.a the average noise for these 6 time samples

Step 2): for 5000 events:

  2.1) offset for each strip = Mean value of step 1.2)

  2.2) noise for each strip = RMS value of step 1.3)

summary: in this algorithm, except step 1.1), strips in all other steps 
         are isolated: the calculation
         of noise and offset of each strip has nothing to do 
         with the other rest strips

// The procedure previously used in GEM pedestal calculation for MPD

Step 1): in each event
    
    1.1) for each time sample, sort the 128 strip ADC value
         discard the highest 28 ADC values, discard the lowest
         28 ADC values, take the average of the rest 72 strip
         ADC values as commonModeValue

         in this time sample, for the 128 strip ADCs, subtract 
         each strip ADC value by that commonModeValue

    1.2) generate a temprary histo for each strip
         fill with the average ADC of the 6 time samples for each strip

step 2): for 5000 events
    
    2.1) strip offset = mean value of the histo in step 1.2)

    2.2) strip noise = RMS value of the histo in step 1.2)

summary: in this algorithm, strip is not isolated. In step 1.1)
         the common mode value is an average of all the middle
         strips
